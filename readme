### Prerequisites
Docker Desktop: Make sure you have Docker Desktop installed on your machine. You can download and install it from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

### Installation Steps
1. Download and Extract Lab Files: Download the lab1.zip file and extract its contents to your desired directory.

2. Navigate to Directory: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you extracted the lab files. This directory should contain the docker-compose.yml file.

3. Run Docker Compose: Use the following command to start the Docker containers:

`http://localhost:8888/`

5. Open and Run Lab Notebook: In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the lab1.ipynb file and open it. Run all cells in the notebook to execute the code and complete the lab.

6. Finish: Once you have completed the lab exercises, you can stop the Docker containers by running:
`docker-compose down`
